title: Time zone for Git aoc study updated
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  In Git areas of code study use the time zone (`tz` field) from
  the author date instead of the committer date to be the same as
  Git index dates.

  Also include `committer_tz` in the index so it is available if
  needed.
